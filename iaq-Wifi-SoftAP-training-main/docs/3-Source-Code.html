			<summary>3.2 Edit the IICA0 Driver</summary>
			<p>
				The I<sup>2</sup>C base driver doesn't provide the appropriate functionality out of the box - so let's edit it and
				give ourselves the functions we need, this is namely an I<sup>2</sup>C send function which triggers when there's a error or event completion flag.<br><br>
				Navigate to <b>[src] &rarr; [smc_gen] &rarr; [Config_IICA0] &rarr; Config_IICA0_user.c</b><br>
				You can edit the file in section starting with the "Start user code for function..." comment gaurd - place the following
				function declarations.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Function:</b> r_Config_IICA0_callback_master_sendend
				<pre>
				<code class="C">rm_comms_i2c_bus0_callback(false);</code>

				Now, let's edit the UART base driver with the appropriate functionality to achieve desired function requirementsed, this is namely an UART sendend and receive end function which triggers when there's a send and receive completion flag respectively.<br><br>
				Navigate to <b>[src] &rarr; [smc_gen] &rarr; [Config_UARTA0] &rarr; Config_UARTA0_user.c</b><br>
				You can edit the file in section starting with the "Start user code for function..." comment gaurd - place the following

			<summary>3.3 Populate TAU00 ISR</summary>
			<p>
				The clockwise timer counter needs it's ISR populating - this ISR fires everytime timer runs out to make sure the UART connection with DA16200 functions timely. We fill this ISR with some code so the
				application can be made aware of a clockwise rotation.<br><br>
				Now first we need to include our "main.h" file from earlier to enable the ISR to communicate with the
				application.
				Navigate to the <b>[src] &rarr; [smc_gen] &rarr; [Config_TAU0_0] &rarr; Config_TAU0_0_user.c</b> &amp;
				copy the code below into the includes section of the file, inside the "Start user code for include..."
				comment gaurd.
			</p>
			<pre><code class="C">#include "HAL.h"</code></pre>
			<p>Then add the following the global variable declaration section</p>
			<pre>
			<code class="C">extern bool oneshot_timer_done;</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
				Finally inside the r_Config_TAU0_0_interrupt isr, please place the following code. This code
				signals to the application that the timer ran out. It also
				clears the interrupt flags <b>both</b> timers as a debounce precaution. It should be
				placed within the "Start user code for r_Config_TAU0_0_interrupt..." comment gaurd.
			</p>
			<pre>
			<code class="C">oneshot_timer_done = true;
R_Config_TAU0_0_Stop();</code>

			<summary>3.4 Populate TAU05 ISR</summary>
			<p>
				The sensor counter needs it's ISR populating - this ISR fires every milisecond to make sure the sensor reading is initiated after the sensor measurement is completed. We fill this ISR with some code so the
				application functions properly.<br><br>
				Now first we need to include our function in the header file.
				Navigate to the <b>[src] &rarr; [smc_gen] &rarr; [Config_TAU0_5] &rarr; Config_TAU0_5.h</b> &amp;
				copy the code below at the end of the file, inside the "Start user code for function..."
				comment gaurd.
			</p>
			<pre><code class="C">void R_Config_TAU0_5_Blocking_Wait(void);</code></pre>

				Next navigate to the corresponding <b>Config_TAU0_4_user.c</b> file ([src] &rarr; [smc_gen] &rarr;
				[Config_TAU0_5] &rarr; Config_TAU0_5_user.c) and please add the following code at the bottom of the file,
				again within the comment gaurd "Start user code for adding...".

			<summary>3.6 Application Explained <i>[Informative]</i></summary>
			<p>
				As the section name implies this in informative, there are no actions in this step and it can be freely
				skipped. But this section aims to explain the application code and provide a clear understanding of why
				&amp; how certain things have been done. We will do this by combing through the code, picking out
				lines of code or groups of lines of code in order to dissect what is happening.<br><br>

				The application codes in the folder looks like <br>
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/lab_layout.png" alt=""><br>
			<p>
				The folder has a following files and what it signifies<br>
				<ol>
					<li>
						da16200_AT - All of the code involving AT commands to communicate with DA16200 to initiate Wifi or connect to a wifi connection.
					</li>
					<li>
						http_server - This code has all the function involving the hosting of http server and the design of the html webpage that will be hosted. This the webpage where the sensor updates will be visible.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sensor - These files entail the functions which initiates sensors and read the sensor values.
					</li>
				</ol>
				The application is simple, the main loop infinitely waits for either of the following events.
				<ol>
					<li>
						Refresh of the webpage at a schedules interval to make sure the sensor value is updated.
					</li>
					<li>
						A user induced webpage get request i.e. user refreshes the webpage.
					</li>
					<li>
						User clickes LED toggle button on the webpage to turn on/off LED.
					</li>
				</ol><br>
				The main function which includes the main loop is explained below.
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/main_loop.gif" alt=""><br>
			<p>
				The first part of the program is wifi initialization (wifi_init Function) which requires a sequence of AT
				commands. AT commands are the medium of interraction for DA16200, and to initiate this AT command communication
				we give a <b>ATZ</b>. Once AT commands are initiated, the user might wish to see what command was send before
				the response is received to avoid confusion. This can be achieved using Echo mode. Echo mode would reflect/Echo
				back the command that was sent by the user making sure the sequence shown is Command-Response-Command-Response....<br>
				The wifi_init function and th AT commands used can be seen in the da16200_AT.c file as follows. To get to the function, you can ctrl+click on the
				wifi_init function in the project main file.
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/Wifi_init.gif" alt=""><br>
			<p>
				The list of the AT commands used and the expected responses can be found in the start of the da16200_AT.c.
				The main AT command of interest is WFSAP, a command used to setup Soft AP interface. A soft-AP needs
				following arguments to set up.
				<ol>
					<li>
						AP SSID: Name of the Wi-Fi
					</li>
					<li>
						Security Protocol:
						<ul>
							<li>0 - open</li>
							<li>2 - WPA</li>
							<li>3 - WPA2</li>
							<li>4 - WPA+WPA2</li>
							<li>5 - WPA3 OWE</li>
							<li>6 - WPA3 SAE</li>
							<li>7 - WPA2 RSN &amp; WPA3 SAE</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Encryption:
						<ul>
							<li>0 - TKIP</li>
							<li>1 - AES</li>
							<li>2 - TKIP+AES</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Passphrase: Password for your Wi-Fi
					</li>
					<li>
						Country code
					</li>
				</ol>
				The AT commands in the file and the WFSAP used in the project looks as follows in the code.
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/Soft_AP_setup.gif" alt=""><br>
			<p> The Soft-AP initialize and setup chain looks as follows</p>
			<img style="max-width:90%;" src="img/img_lab/AT_command.png" alt=""><br>
			<p>
				Now moving to the sensor part of the project. This is the explaination of the code file sensor.c and the
				sensor_read function which is used to get the sensor reading. The code is divided into two sections, the
				first section is where the sensor is triggered to start measurements. The second section is initiated
				after the successfull completion of the first section. This part reads the acquired measurement in a raw
				format and then calculates a temperature and humdity value out of the raw sensor data.<br>
				The code for executing this and it's stages are explained below.
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/sensor_read.gif" alt=""><br>
			<p>
				The final piece of the project is the webpage that is showing the sensor value graphically. This involves http_update
				function from the code file http_server.c. The layout of the html page is described in the start of the code. The
				http_update function gets the last read sensor value which then decides the colour of the graph depiciting the value.
				Once all of the data is gathered in one string it is then attached to the html page. This update html page is then
				uploaded for the user to view. <br> Note: the webpage will auto refresh every 10 seconds.<br>
				The code for http update is as follows
